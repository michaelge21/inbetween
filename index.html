        <h2>let's talk about Asian mental health.</h2>
        <p class="introMissionPara">
          in-between is a student-led conversation-starter driving dialogue
          around subjects more stressful than final exams-- our identities and
          health.
        </p>
        <span
          ><p>
            We've recently felt our Asian identity's increased weight on mental
            health and holistic wellness. It was hard to de-tangle generations
            of stigma alone, though, and we never grew up openly discussing our
            mental health. Hesitantly, in 2019, we asked our Asian peers if they
            needed these chats too.
          </p></span

        <h3>
          2 conferences, 20+ speakers, and 300+ attendees later, we're
          confidently getting the conversation started.
