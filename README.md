# Welcome to In-Between's webpage!

This project is in-progress. The designer and developer (me) recognizes that lots of this isn't optimized for production yet, and I want to remind any potential viewers that this is not a final piece.

Huge thanks to:

- WashU's Student Union for funding this conference
- [TypeIt](https://www.typeitjs.com/), a JS library used for the typewriter effect on this site. The documentation is clean and free usage is allowed for non-commercial purposes-- check them out!
- The in-between team. Photos are taken either from press kits provided by speakers, public promotion materials, or were taken live at the event by our hard-working PR teams. Photography by students of all attendees is allowed per the Service Provider Event Agreement, X: Intellectual Property, subcolumn d.
