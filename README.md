# Welcome to In-Between's webpage!

In-Between is a pan-Asian mental health conference founded in 2019 by students. Michael Ge is the webmaster and designer for in-between's inaugural site, and also led/spoke at the event in 2022.

This project is in-progress. Much isn't optimized for production yet.
