# Welcome to In-Between's webpage!

In-Between is a pan-Asian mental health conference founded in 2019 by students at Washington University in St. Louis. Michael Ge is the webmaster and designer for in-between's inaugural site, and also led/spoke at the event in 2022.

This project is in-progress. Much isn't optimized for production yet. This has been built with the three vanilla pillars of web development (HTML, CSS, JS), with minimal usage of outside dependencies and packages. I will likely rebuild this site with a whole new toolchain when I am more comfortable with tooling-- as of now, I'm planning on using Parcel, Vue, and Netlify.

Huge thanks to:

- WashU's Student Union for funding this conference
- [TypeIt](https://www.typeitjs.com/), a JS library used for the typewriter effect on this site. The documentation is clean and free usage is allowed for non-commercial purposes-- check them out!
- The in-between team. Photos are taken either from press kits provided by speakers, public promotion materials, or were taken live at the event by our hard-working PR teams. Photography by students of all attendees is allowed per the Service Provider Event Agreement, X: Intellectual Property, subcolumn d.
